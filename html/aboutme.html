    <p>Hi! My name is Ashle Martinson :) I'm from North Carolina.
        I'm currently attending BYU. I'm studying communications with a minor in 
        business. I love swimming, weightlifting, and spending time with 
        friends and family. </p>

  <div id="Joy"> <h4>Things That Bring Me Joy</h4> </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Going on walks</li>
            <ul>
                <li>My favorite thing to do is put in headphones
                    go on a walk and pretend I'm the main character
                    in a random movie.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Baking cookies</li>
        <ul>
            <li> I'll be honest I like eating the cookie dough
                more than the baked cokies
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Animals</li>
        <ul>
            <li> I like the traditional pets, like cats and dogs,
                but I also adore goats, chickens, and donkeys.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Watching movies</li>
        <ul>
            <li> I love a good romcom, but I also adore
                classic action movies. Honestly, it's more about
                the experience of watching movies with family and friends
                for me.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Swimming and spending time in the ocean</li>
        <ul>
            <li> I've swam competitively since I was 6 years old.
                I think the water will always be my happy place. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
